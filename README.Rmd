## About

This package provides broad functionality for IRMS data processing and reduction pipelines.

Existing functionality includes signal conversion (voltage to current and back), time scaling (continuous flow chromatograms), isotope ratio calculations, delta value calculations, as well as easy-to-use highly flexible data calibration and visualization pipelines for continuous flow data. Additional tools on O17 corrections, H3 factor calculation, peak detection, baseline correction, etc are in the works. All implemented functions are well documented and ready for use. However, since this package is still in active development some syntax and function names may still change.

## Installation

You can install the dependency [isoreader](http://isoreader.isoverse.org/) and [isoprocessor](http://isoprocessor.isoverse.org/) itself both from GitHub using the `devtools` package. Note that while [isoprocessor](http://isoprocessor.isoverse.org/) uses some functions from [isoreader](http://isoreader.isoverse.org/), it does NOT require IRMS data to be read with [isoreader](http://isoreader.isoverse.org/), it can be used standalone with raw data obtained differently.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # only if you don't have this installed yet
devtools::install_github("isoverse/isoreader")
devtools::install_github("isoverse/isoprocessor")
```

## Functionality

 - for a full reference of all available functions, see the **[Function Reference](http://isoprocessor.isoverse.org/reference/)**
 - for an example of how to work with continuos flow data, see the vignette on **[Continuous Flow](http://isoprocessor.isoverse.org/articles/continuous_flow.html)**
 - for an example of how to work with dual inlet data, see the vignette on **[Dual Inlet](http://isoprocessor.isoverse.org/articles/dual_inlet.html)**
 - for an example of how Thermo Isodat in particular calculates isotope ratios for standard continuous flow and dual inlet data, see the **[Isodat calculations notebook](http://isoprocessor.isoverse.org/other/how_isodat_calculates_R.html)**
 - additional vignettes on data reduction and calibration are in the works:

## Open Source

[isoprocessor](http://isoprocessor.isoverse.org/) is and will always be fully open-source (i.e. free as in 'freedom' and free as in 'free beer') and is provided as is. The source code is released under GPL-2.
